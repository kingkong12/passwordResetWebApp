## Styled Components

Styled components gives us a way to, you guessed it, style our components. Here are some of the benefits:

#### They're just React components

It allows us to stay aligned with a component driven development workflow, minimizing deeply nested `div` tags with no meaning, increasing reusability, and keeping styles close to their UI that they manipulate (easier to maintain). Check out [Getting Started](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/basics#getting-started).

#### Write CSS like normal

Write regular CSS, with automatic vendor prefixing, plus the added benefit of being able to pass variables (props) as you would with regular components. See how to pass props [here](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/basics#getting-started)

#### Reusable themes and global styles

Use a Theme Provider to pass style themes to all your nested components. You can even make Sub Themes that can override parent themes. We can also replace our index.css file with the more flexible `createGlobalStyles`. Learn more about [themes here](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#theming) and [creteGlobalStyles here](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/api#createglobalstyle)

## Available Scripts

npm run eslint-check. It helps to verify any inconsistemt eslint rules with Prettier.
